# zigtorrent

My solution to BitTorrent CodeCrafters challenge in Zig.

## Features
- Download a piece
- Download a file
- Succesfully downloaded a [debian iso](https://cdimage.debian.org/debian-cd/current/amd64/bt-cd/)

## Todo
- Move Piece downloading logic
- Pipelining block requests?
- Performance upgrade with threads
- Magnet links
- Abstracting argument parsing (by me or by a dependency)

Current stage = 12/19
