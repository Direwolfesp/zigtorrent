# zigtorrent

'Toy' Bittorrenct (original spec) CLI client that serves as a learning proyect for myself so its not expected to work optimally.  

## Features
- Download a piece
- Download a file
- Succesfully downloaded a [debian iso](https://cdimage.debian.org/debian-cd/current/amd64/bt-cd/)
- Multithreaded (works but is a bit experimental)

## Todo
- More testing (ie. torrents such as ubuntu iso don't work)
- Multifile torrents
- Magnet links
- Support seeding
- DHT
